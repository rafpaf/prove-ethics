% 1p14: Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.
% 
% Dem.: Since God is an absolutely infinite being, of whom no attribute which
% expresses an essence of substance can be denied (by 1def6), and he
% necessarily exists (by 1p11), if there were any substance except God, it
% would have to be explained through some attribute of God, and so two
% substances of the same attribute would exist, which (by 1p5) is absurd. And
% so except God, no substance can be or, consequently, be conceived.  For if it
% could be conceived, it would have to be conceived as existing.  But this (by
% the first part of this demonstration) is absurd. Therefore, except for God no
% substance can be or be conceived, q.e.d.

1. 1def6 [Given.]

2. 1p11 [Given.]

% Every substance has an attribute.
3. [Given.]
all S ( is_substance(S) -> ( exists A ( is_attribute_of(A, S) ) ) ).

4. 1p5 [Given.]

% If there exists an S such that S is a substance and S is not a god, then
% there would be two substances of the same attribute.
5. [From 1, 2, 3, 4.]
(
    exists S
    (
        is_substance(S) and
        S!=God
    )
)
->
(
    exists S exists T exists A
    (
        (S!=T) and
        is_attribute_of(A,S) and
        is_attribute(A,T)
    )
).

C. all S ( is_substance(S) -> (S=God) ).
