% Note: the "exists" of predicate logic is not the "is" of Spinoza's
% philosophy. I am having trouble explaining how I use prover9's "exists",

% translatable into a contemporary predicate logic, which has too many
% contemporary assumptions built into it. Perhaps what could be said in defense
% of this project is that it will make plainer---in the things that couldn't be
% captured--exactly where Spinoza departs from today's "common sense".
