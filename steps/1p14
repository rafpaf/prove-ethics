% Dem.: Since God is an absolutely infinite being, of whom no attribute which

% would have to be explained through some attribute of God, and so two
% substances of the same attribute would exist, which (by 1p5) is absurd.  And
% so except God, no substance can be or, consequently, be conceived.  For if it
% could be conceived, it would have to be conceived as existing.  But this (by
% the first part of this demonstration) is absurd. Therefore, except for God no
% substance can be or be conceived, q.e.d.
