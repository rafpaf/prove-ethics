    % This encompasses this bit:
    % "All modes by which a body is affected by another body follow both from
    % the nature of the body affected at at the same time from the nature of
    % the affecting body..."
    
    % I'm ignoring this bit, which I take to just be a gloss:
    % "so that one and the same body may be moved differently according to
    % differences in the nature of the bodies moving it. And conversely,
    % different bodies may be moved differently by one and the same body."

    all mode all body

            % all modes of the body...
            mode_of(mode,body) &
            % ...with an external cause...
            exists body2 ( cause(body2,mode) & -(body2=body) )
