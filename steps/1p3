% 1p3: If things have nothing in common with one

% Dem.: If they have nothing in common with one
% another, then (by 1a5) they cannot be understood
% through one another, and so (by 1a4) one cannot be
% the cause of the other, q.e.d.

% Used in 1p6

formulas(assumptions).

    % Given two things,
    all a all b (

        % If there is no thing that they both have, ...
        -(exists t ( has(a, t) & has(b, t) ))

        % ...then...
        ->

        % ...neither is understood through nor causes the other.

% Note that "they cannot be understood through one another" must mean "neither
% can be understood through the another", although strictly speaking it could
% mean that it is impossible to (simultaneously?) understand each through the
