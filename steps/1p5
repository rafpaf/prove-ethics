% Dem.: If there were two or more distinct substances, they would have
% to be distinguished from one another either by a difference in their
% attributes, or by a difference in their affections (by 1p4). If only
% by a difference in their attributes, then it will be conceded that
% there is only one of the same attribute. But if by a difference in
% their affections, then since a substance is prior in nature to its
% affections (by 1p1), if the affections are put to one side and [the
% substance] is considered in itself, i.e. (by 1def3 and 1a6),
% considered truly, one cannot be conceived to be distinguished from
% another, i.e. (by 1p4), there cannot be many, but only one [of the
% same nature or attribute], q.e.d.
