% Dem.: This Proposition must be plain to anyone, provided he attends to the
% fact that the intellect infers from the given definition of any thing a
% number of properties that really do follow necessarily from it (i.e., from
% the very essence of the thing); and that it infers more properties the more
% the definition of the thing expresses reality, i.e., the more reality the
% essence of the defined thing involves. But since the divine nature has
% absolutely infinite attributes (by 1def6), each of which also expresses an
% essence infinite in its own kind, from its necessity there must follow
% infinitely many things in infinite modes (i.e., everything which can fall
% under an infinite intellect), q.e.d.
